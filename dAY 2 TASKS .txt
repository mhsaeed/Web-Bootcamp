Section 3:
11. Write a program that searches for number n in an array of 5 (where n is user input).
12. Write a program that checks if a string is a palindrome.
13. Write a program that finds the largest and smallest number in an unsorted array of integers.
14. Write a program that prints a right angle triangle using the "*" character, with the height based on user input. (using loops and following is only sample input)

*
**
***
****
*****


15. Write a program that prints the following pattern up to n rows (where n is user input).

      *
     *** 
    *****
   *******
 *********


Section 4:
16. Write a program that takes a string as input and outputs the reverse of that string. For example, if the input is "hello," the output should be "olleh." 
17. Write a program that sorts an array. (take input as random numbers)
18. Write a program that checks if a given number is a perfect number.
(sum of all divisors excluding itself should be equal to that number e.g.; 1 + 2 + 3 = 6)
19. Write a program that prints the following pattern up to n rows (where n is user input).

1
12
123
1234
...
123...n

20. Write a program that finds the longest common subsequence of two given strings. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order but not necessarily contiguous. For example, for the input strings "ABCDGH" and "AEDFHR," the longest common subsequence is "ADH."
